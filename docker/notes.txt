Tried to install kcov
No joy

Tried to install tarpaulin
RUN cargo install --force cargo-tarpaulin

This installs but when you use it you get this error:
Error: "Failed to run tests: ASLR disable failed: EPERM: Operation not permitted"

https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin/README.md
suggests that you need this option on docker run...
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
